	<DESCRIPTION>To support their latest release on Eyeball Record's, we were asked by the lovely gents of The Number 12 Looks Like You, to design the packaging and marketing materials. We constructed a massive collage element for the project, that we then dissected into various components used to produce album artwork, tshirt designs, and a myspace page.</DESCRIPTION>

	<TITLE>Foxy Shazam</TITLE>
	<DESCRIPTION>For Foxy's first full-length release on New Weatherman Records and Ferret Management, they needed something big and something bold to match their sound. Selecting photography from prior shoots, we directed the art and design of the packaging to help illustrate their frenetic musical personality and bizarre personal showmanships. Bringing about seemingly random and bizarre requests, such as basketball games and scheduled dance step motiffs, we organized these images into a harmonized layout. </DESCRIPTION>
